        <h1>My Favorite Pastimes and Hobbies</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Watching Youtube!</li>
            <dd>
                I like to watch many youtubers, but lately I've been watching a lot of Caleb Hammer's 
                financial audits. Trust me, they're more interesting than they sound.
            </dd>
            <li>Reading webnovels!</li>
            <dd>
                I spend way too much time reading webnovels, but there never seems to be a day where I can't find a novel that catches my interest. 
                This hobby of mine is more of an aquired taste as many people hate reading.
            </dd>
            <li>Playing games with friends!</li>
            <dd>
                My friends and I are always up to random shenanigans in any game you can think of. 
                Incidentally, this has become the extent of my social life since highschool ended.
            </dd>
            <li>Listening to music!</li>
            <dd>
                I can spend the entire day just listening to music. I always have an earbud in anywhere
                I go, and you can bet I'm jamming out.
